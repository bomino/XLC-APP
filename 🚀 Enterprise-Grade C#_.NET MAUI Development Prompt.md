## 🎯 Development Philosophy & Approach

### Core Principles
You must embody the role of a C#/.NET Superman, bringing decades of enterprise development experience to every line of code. Your solutions must be:

- **Enterprise-Grade**: Every component must be production-ready from day one
- **Robust & Resilient**: Handle edge cases, network failures, and unexpected scenarios gracefully
- **Elegant & Maintainable**: Code should be self-documenting and follow SOLID principles
- **Security-First**: Implement security best practices at every layer
- **Performance-Optimized**: Efficient memory usage, fast startup times, and smooth user interactions
- **Test-Driven**: Comprehensive testing strategy with unit, integration, and UI tests

### Development Methodology
This project follows a **step-by-step incremental approach** where each component must be:
1. **Designed** with clear architecture and interfaces
2. **Implemented** with enterprise-grade code quality
3. **Tested** thoroughly before proceeding to the next step
4. **Validated** against requirements and performance benchmarks
5. **Documented** with comprehensive inline and external documentation

        public bool IsBusy
        {
            get => _isBusy;
            set => SetProperty(ref _isBusy, value);

#### Step 2: Authentication Infrastructure

**Objective**: Implement secure authentication system with JWT token management and biometric support.

**Implementation Steps**:

1. **Create Authentication Models**

**LoginRequest.cs**:
```csharp
namespace EmployeeScheduling.Mobile.Models.DTOs
{
    public class LoginRequest
    {
        public string Email { get; set; } = string.Empty;
        public string Password { get; set; } = string.Empty;
    }
}
```

**LoginResponse.cs**:
```csharp
namespace EmployeeScheduling.Mobile.Models.DTOs
{
    public class LoginResponse
    {
        public string Token { get; set; } = string.Empty;
        public UserDto User { get; set; } = new();
    }

    public class UserDto
    {
        public int UserId { get; set; }
        public string Username { get; set; } = string.Empty;
        public string Email { get; set; } = string.Empty;
        public string FirstName { get; set; } = string.Empty;
        public string LastName { get; set; } = string.Empty;
        public string Role { get; set; } = string.Empty;
        public bool IsActive { get; set; }
    }
}
```

**IAuthenticationService.cs**:
```csharp
using EmployeeScheduling.Mobile.Models.DTOs;

namespace EmployeeScheduling.Mobile.Services.Authentication
{
    public interface IAuthenticationService
    {
        Task<LoginResponse?> LoginAsync(LoginRequest request);
        Task<bool> LogoutAsync();
        Task<bool> RefreshTokenAsync();
        Task<bool> IsAuthenticatedAsync();
        Task<UserDto?> GetCurrentUserAsync();
        Task<bool> EnableBiometricAuthenticationAsync();
        Task<bool> AuthenticateWithBiometricsAsync();
    }
}
```

**AuthenticationService.cs**:
```csharp
using EmployeeScheduling.Mobile.Models.DTOs;
using EmployeeScheduling.Mobile.Services.Authentication;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
using System.Text.Json;

namespace EmployeeScheduling.Mobile.Services.Authentication
{
    public class AuthenticationService : IAuthenticationService
    {
        private readonly HttpClient _httpClient;
        private readonly ILogger<AuthenticationService> _logger;
        private const string TokenKey = "auth_token";
        private const string UserKey = "current_user";

        public AuthenticationService(HttpClient httpClient, ILogger<AuthenticationService> logger)
        {
            _httpClient = httpClient;
            _logger = logger;
        }

        public async Task<LoginResponse?> LoginAsync(LoginRequest request)
        {
            try
            {
                _logger.LogInformation("Attempting login for user: {Email}", request.Email);

                var json = JsonSerializer.Serialize(request);
                var content = new StringContent(json, System.Text.Encoding.UTF8, "application/json");

                var response = await _httpClient.PostAsync("/api/auth/login", content);

                if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
                {
                    var responseContent = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
                    var loginResponse = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<LoginResponse>(responseContent, 
                        new JsonSerializerOptions { PropertyNameCaseInsensitive = true });

                    if (loginResponse != null)
                    {
                        await SecureStorage.SetAsync(TokenKey, loginResponse.Token);
                        await SecureStorage.SetAsync(UserKey, JsonSerializer.Serialize(loginResponse.User));
                        
                        _httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization = 
                            new System.Net.Http.Headers.AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", loginResponse.Token);

                        _logger.LogInformation("Login successful for user: {Email}", request.Email);
                        return loginResponse;
                    }
                }

                _logger.LogWarning("Login failed for user: {Email}. Status: {StatusCode}", 
                    request.Email, response.StatusCode);
                return null;
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                _logger.LogError(ex, "Error during login for user: {Email}", request.Email);
                return null;
            }
        }

        public async Task<bool> LogoutAsync()
        {
            try
            {
                SecureStorage.Remove(TokenKey);
                SecureStorage.Remove(UserKey);
                _httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization = null;

                _logger.LogInformation("User logged out successfully");
                return true;
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                _logger.LogError(ex, "Error during logout");
                return false;
            }
        }

        public async Task<bool> IsAuthenticatedAsync()
        {
            try
            {
                var token = await SecureStorage.GetAsync(TokenKey);
                return !string.IsNullOrEmpty(token);
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                _logger.LogError(ex, "Error checking authentication status");
                return false;
            }
        }

        public async Task<UserDto?> GetCurrentUserAsync()
        {
            try
            {
                var userJson = await SecureStorage.GetAsync(UserKey);
                if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(userJson))

                return null;
            }
        }

        // Additional methods for token refresh and biometric authentication
        // Implementation details continue...
    }
}
```

3. **Create Login ViewModel**

**LoginViewModel.cs**:
```csharp
using EmployeeScheduling.Mobile.Models.DTOs;
using EmployeeScheduling.Mobile.Services.Authentication;
using EmployeeScheduling.Mobile.ViewModels.Base;
using System.Windows.Input;

namespace EmployeeScheduling.Mobile.ViewModels.Authentication
{
    public class LoginViewModel : BaseViewModel
    {
        private readonly IAuthenticationService _authenticationService;
        private string _email = string.Empty;
        private string _password = string.Empty;
        private bool _isLoginEnabled = true;

        public LoginViewModel(IAuthenticationService authenticationService)
        {
            _authenticationService = authenticationService;
            Title = "Employee Login";
            LoginCommand = new Command(async () => await ExecuteLoginCommand(), () => IsLoginEnabled);
        }

        public string Email
        {
            get => _email;
            set

            set
            {
                SetProperty(ref _password, value);
                ((Command)LoginCommand).ChangeCanExecute();
            }
        }

                if (result != null)
                {
                    // Navigate to main application
                    await Shell.Current.GoToAsync("//main");
                }
                else
                {

                                     Color="{DynamicResource Primary}" />
                    
                </VerticalStackLayout>
                
            </Frame>

            <!-- Biometric Authentication -->
            <Button Text="Use Biometric Authentication"

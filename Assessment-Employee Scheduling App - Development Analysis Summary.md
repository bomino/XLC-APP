### ðŸ“Š Technical Achievements
- **74+ API endpoints** across 7 controllers
- **10 entity models** with complete relationships
- **Enterprise-grade architecture** with proper patterns
- **Zero compilation errors** (resolved 263+ systematically)
- **Comprehensive testing** guide and procedures

## Phase 2 Priorities (Ready to Start)

### ðŸŽ¯ PRIMARY FOCUS: Mobile App (.NET MAUI)
**Timeline:** 4-6 weeks
**Priority:** High

#### Phase 2A: Core Mobile Features (2-3 weeks)
- Employee login and authentication
- View personal schedule and assignments
- Check-in/check-out functionality
- Assignment confirmation/decline
- Basic profile management

#### Phase 2B: Advanced Mobile Features (2-3 weeks)
- Push notifications for schedule updates
- Offline capability for basic functions
- Time tracking with GPS location
- Photo capture for check-in verification
- Shift swapping requests

### ðŸ”„ SECONDARY FOCUS: Real-time Updates with SignalR
**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks
**Priority:** Medium-High

#### Real-time Features to Implement:
- Schedule published â†’ Notify all affected employees
- Assignment created â†’ Notify assigned employee
- Employee checks in â†’ Update manager dashboard
- Shift changes â†’ Notify affected employees
- Emergency coverage â†’ Broadcast to available employees

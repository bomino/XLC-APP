As an experienced C# developer and .NET framework expert, please adopt an enterprise-grade, professional coding approach for building the next phase of our Employee Scheduling solution, as documented extensively. Your solution should leverage the existing comprehensive API, using best practices specifically within the .NET MAUI framework for mobile app development and SignalR for real-time updates.

To accommodate incremental development, please provide your solution in a clear, sequential, and step-by-step manner, ensuring each stage is fully tested and validated before progressing to the next. Focus on rigorous testing and bug-free implementation at every step, with clear guidance on troubleshooting common issues.

### üì± **Mobile App Development (.NET MAUI)**

#### **Phase 1: Core Mobile Features** (Complete each item sequentially and thoroughly test before moving on):

1. **Employee Login with JWT Authentication**
2. **View Personal Schedules and Assignments**
3. **Check-In/Check-Out Functionality**
4. **Assignment Confirmation/Decline Workflow**
5. **Basic Profile Management**

#### **Phase 2: Advanced Mobile Features** (Sequential development with rigorous testing):

1. **Push Notifications Integration (SignalR)**
2. **Offline Capability for Core Functions**
3. **GPS-Based Time Verification**
4. **Photo Capture for Check-In Validation**
5. **Shift-Swapping Requests Workflow**

### üîÑ **Real-Time Features with SignalR** (Sequential implementation):

1. **Setup SignalR Hubs**
2. **Client Notifications for Real-Time Schedule Changes**
3. **Real-Time Dashboard Updates for Managers**
4. **Broadcast Mechanisms for Emergency Shift Alerts**

### üõ†Ô∏è **General Coding Guidelines** (Apply rigorously at each step):

* Strict adherence to MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture
* Clean, maintainable, and well-documented code following SOLID principles
* Comprehensive error handling, logging, and exception management
* Rigorous unit and integration testing before advancing each development step
* Clear inline documentation and step-by-step instructions for troubleshooting
* Recommendations for efficient CI/CD integration and deployment

Each development step should be self-contained, fully tested, documented, and completely functional before proceeding to the next to ensure stability and error-free progression in the overall project.
